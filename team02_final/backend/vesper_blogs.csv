1,"You shouldn't overwater",Isaac Lo,"The number one thing you shouldn't do is overwater your orchids! Proper watering is crucial for the health and well-being of orchids, and avoiding overwatering is a key practice that can lead to several benefits. Orchids, known for their exotic and delicate appearance, are adapted to thrive in specific conditions. Overwatering can lead to root rot, a common issue for orchids, as it deprives the roots of essential oxygen. By allowing the orchid's growing medium to dry out between waterings, excess moisture is prevented, promoting aeration and maintaining a healthy balance. This practice not only helps prevent root diseases but also encourages the development of a robust root system. Additionally, avoiding overwatering supports the orchid's natural growth cycle, mimicking the intermittent periods of wet and dry conditions they experience in their native habitats. Overall, proper watering habits contribute to the longevity and vibrancy of orchids, ensuring they flourish and produce stunning blooms in a well-balanced environment.",,0
